* Overview

This is an [[https://esphome.io][ESPHome]] project called *pulse-for-esphome*, based on the Home Assistant Glow
which was originally created in 2011. (For more background on this project see: [[https://glow-energy.io]])

The first version of this device (hardware and firmware) has been released and
is available as a kit or completed unit. As it is also open hardware, you can
also use these files to create your own device.

* Repository
- GitHub: https://github.com/PaulSchulz/pulse-for-esphome

* Hardware Development
** Kicad
Kicad has been used to create a printed circuit board (PCB) which is used to
mount the microcontroller and connector for the 'flash' sensor (photodiode)
and pulse LED (for monitoring).

** M5StampS3 Microcontroller Board

The M5StampS3 is a microcontroller board, using the ESP32-S3 microcontroller
(MCU) which is a very capable processor for running ESPHome firmware. [[https://m5stack.com/][M5Stack]]
have mounted the processor, WiFi antenna, USB-C connector, Button and Status LED in a
very handy [[https://shop.m5stack.com/products/m5stamps3a-with-1-27-header-pin][inexpensive package]].
